# COMP303 Software Design (Winter 2019)

## Description
This course provides an in-depth introduction to the discipline of software design for building realistic and high-quality software applications. It will focus on object-oriented programming techniques, and cover topics related to managing software complexity and verifying that they work as expected. It will use Java for all the code examples and assignments. However, the considerations during the design process apply in all languages for practical software development.
