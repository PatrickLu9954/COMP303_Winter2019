# Module 2 - Answers

Answers and answer sketches to the Module 2 practice exercises.

## Exercises 1, 2, 3, and 5

The sample code can be found [here](Hand.java). 

## Exercise 4

**Hints:** Your comparator class should have a field of an enumerated type, a way to set the value of the field, and use this value in the `compare` method.

## Exercise 6

Since this is a model, small variants are possible. For example, the model would also be correct and useful without the interfaces `Edge` and `Node`. Those interfaces are added for answering the question "What is a `GraphElement`?". Only a subset of the methods in `SelectionList` are included to give the best idea of how the class "worked", and left out a bunch of state querying methods.

## Optional Excerse 2

Sample answers can be found in the [Solitaire GitHub repo](https://github.com/prmr/Solitaire). In the current solution, instead of creating individual `SuitStack` classes, they are managed through a single `Foundations`. However, it's not a bad idea to try it as suggested first.
