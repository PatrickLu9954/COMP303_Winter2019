# Module 5 - Answers

Answers and answer sketches to the Module 5 practice exercises.

## Exercise 1

Note that the diagram skips over the initialization of the two `String` objects, which in any case is done under the covers by the compiler because of the use of string literals. It's also interesting to note that the object referenced by `string2` does *not* participate in the sequence at the level of abstraction modeled here. Finally, detailed calls to library methods 
are not normally part of sequence diagrams, but here it was interesting to show what the common `println` statement maps to. 

## Exercise 2

Things to note from this diagram:

* The use of the somewhat "fake" `client` object provides a nice way to provide the context of the object sequence (that is, where the sequence occurs in the code);
* The diagram does not include any detailed code logic, for example the fact that the bottom part of the sequence only occurs if `isEmpty()` returns `false`. That is not the point of a model. People who need that level of detail should look at the code directly.
* The appropriate use of names really increases the clarity of the model. For example, the return edge is annotated with the label `topMove`, then gave this name to the object of type `Move`. From this it should be fairly clear that it's the top move that's being undone, without having to rely of diagram notation.

## Exercise 3

The class must be declared to implement `Cloneable`, and supply a `clone` method. Here we assume that
it's acceptable to make a shallow copy of the card objects, since they are immutable and either unique or systematically tested 
for equality using `equals`. It would also have been a correct answer to deep-copy the card objects, since the design
does not require them to be unique.

```java
public class Hand implements Iterable<Card>, Cloneable
{
   ...
   @Override
   public Hand clone()
   {
      try
      {
         Hand clone = (Hand) super.clone();
         clone.aCards = new ArrayList<>();
         for( Card card : aCards )
         {
            clone.add(card);
         }
         return clone;
      }
      catch(CloneNotSupportedException e)
      {
         assert false;
         return null;
      }
   }
```

## Exercise 4

Here a deep copy of the decorated object is required, otherwise there would be two distinct decorators
decorating the same object. To achieve multi-decoration, the proper way is to nest decorators.

```java
@Override
public ConferenceShow clone()
{
   try
   {
      ConferenceShow clone = (ConferenceShow) super.clone();
      clone.aDecorated = aDecorated.clone();
      return clone;
   }
   catch (CloneNotSupportedException e)
   {
      assert false;
      return null;
   }
}
```

## Exercise 5

In this solution,  a separate class for the `CompositeCommand` is created, since there is no issue with leaking references if they
are already well-encapsulated into the component commands.

```java
public class CompositeCommand implements Command
{
   private List<Command> aCommands = new ArrayList<>();
	
   public CompositeCommand(Command... pCommands )
   {
      for( Command command : pCommands )
      {
         aCommands.add(command);
      }
   }
	
   @Override
   public void execute()
   {
      for( Command command : aCommands )
      {
         command.execute();
      }
   }
}
```

The final piece is to implement a factory for different types of composite commands, for example a `resetAndAdd` command:

```java
public class Program
{
   // Some code

   public void resetAndAdd(Show pShow, Day pDay)
   {
      assert pShow != null && pDay != null;
      Command command = new CompositeCommand(
            () -> Arrays.fill(aShows, NullShow.DEFAULT),
            () -> aShows[pDay.ordinal()] = pShow.clone());
      aCommands.add(command);
      command.execute();
   }
```

## Exercise 6

We define a decorator class as follows:

```java
public class LoggedCommand implements Command
{
	private final Command aCommand;
	private final String aMessage;
	
	public LoggedCommand(Command pCommand, String pMessage)
	{
		aCommand = pCommand;
		aMessage = pMessage;
	}

	@Override
	public void execute()
	{
		aCommand.execute();
		// Decoration
		System.out.println(String.format("Executed command %s", aMessage));				
	}
}
```

and to log a certain command, we wrap it as follows:

```java
public class Program
{
   // Some code

   public void add(Show pShow, Day pDay)
   {
      assert pShow != null && pDay != null;
      Command command = new LoggedCommand(() -> aShows[pDay.ordinal()] = pShow.clone(), "ADD");
      aCommands.add(command);
      command.execute();
   }
```

Here, overriding `toString()` in the various classes in the sample code would open up a whole range of possibilities 
for logging commands with more useful information.

## Exercise 9

You will need two new classes, a `CompositeIcon` and a `ShiftedIcon`.

```java
public class CompositeIcon implements Icon
{
   private final List<Icon> aIcons = new ArrayList<>();
	
   public void addIcon(Icon pIcon)
   {
      aIcons.add(pIcon);
   }
	
   @Override
   public int getIconHeight()
   {
      int max = 0;
      for( Icon icon : aIcons )
      {
         max = Math.max(max, icon.getIconHeight());
      }
      return max;
   }

   @Override
   public int getIconWidth()
   {
      int max = 0;
      for( Icon icon : aIcons )
      {
         max = Math.max(max, icon.getIconWidth());
      }
      return max;
   }

   @Override
   public void paintIcon(Component pComponent, Graphics pGraphics, int pX, int pY)
   {
      for( Icon icon : aIcons )
      {
         icon.paintIcon(pComponent, pGraphics, pX, pY);
      }
   }
}
```

```java
public class ShiftedIcon implements Icon
{
   private final Icon aShiftedIcon;
   private final int aX;
   private final int aY;
	
   public ShiftedIcon(Icon pIcon, int pX, int pY)
   {
      aShiftedIcon = pIcon;
      aX = pX;
      aY = pY;
   }
	

   @Override
   public int getIconHeight()
   {
      return aShiftedIcon.getIconHeight() + aY;
   }

   @Override
   public int getIconWidth()
   {
      return aShiftedIcon.getIconWidth() + aX;
	}

   @Override
   public void paintIcon(Component pComponent, Graphics pGraphics, int pX, int pY)
   {
      aShiftedIcon.paintIcon(pComponent, pGraphics, pX + aX, pY + aY);
   }
}
```

With these two working it's just a matter of creating the desired icon within the constructor and callback in `HandPanel`:

```java
HandPanel()
{
   setBackground(CASINO_GREEN);
   add(aLabel);
   CompositeIcon icon = new CompositeIcon();
   for( int i = 0; i < 13; i++ )
   {
      icon.addIcon(new ShiftedIcon(CardImages.getBack(), 20*i, 5 * i));
   }
   aLabel.setIcon(icon);
}
	
public void showHand(Card[] pHand)
{
   Deck deck = new Deck();
   deck.shuffle();
   CompositeIcon icon = new CompositeIcon();
   for( int i = 0; i < 13; i++ )
   {
      icon.addIcon(new ShiftedIcon(CardImages.getCard(deck.draw()), 20*i, 5 * i));
   }
   aLabel.setIcon(icon);
}
```
