## Exercises

For maximum learning effectiveness, please check the [answers](../Answers/M4-Answers.md) only after giving the problems an honest try.

1. Write unit tests for the Java `Math.abs()` and `Math.min(...)`.

2. Write unit tests for the Java `Stack` methods `pop`, `push`, and `peek`.

3. Create CFGs for all the methods of class [RecentFilesQueue](https://github.com/prmr/JetUML/blob/master/src/ca/mcgill/cs/jetuml/application/RecentFilesQueue.java), except for `serialize` and `deserialize`. With the help of EclEmma, write tests that achieve branch coverage. Manually compute the coverage for all three condition criteria.

## Optional
The following exercises are are optional. The ones prefixed with :star: are more challenging questions aimed to provide you with additional design and programming experience. The ones prefixed with :spades: will incrementally guide you towards the ultimate completion of a complete Solitaire application.

1. :star: Extend the previous exercise to include the `serialize` and `deserialize` methods.

2. :spades: Write unit tests for all the classes of the Solitaire application you have developed so far. Compute the coverage of your test suite with EclEmma.
